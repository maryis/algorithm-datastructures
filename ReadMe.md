 **some notes**

DFS is not optimal, meaning the number of steps in reaching the solution, or the cost spent in reaching it is high.
DFS is complete means it finds the solution is there is any
DP is another version of Recursive, so we can easily convert rec to dp, 
with the same tasks ( basic, and relation to previous item) : check LCS
